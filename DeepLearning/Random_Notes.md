# Bias in ML

+ https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/fairness-overview/

### Types of bias

+ Interaction bias: if data is collected from people interacting with the world, there will be interaction bias resulting from the bias in the way most people interact (e.g., draw a shoe: most people may draw shoes in a similar way)

+ Latent bias: Bias that are latent in the data because particular patterns or categories are very low in number. E.g., scientists were mostly men in the past, leading to a bias towards men to be termed as scientist more often than women if a ML model is trained from images collected without considering this fact.

+ Selection bias: Resulting because not all types of categories are uniformly selected when collecting data. E.g., a particular race missing out when face images are collected.
